    n_freqs : int
        The number of log-spaced ripples to simulate between fmin and fmax
    sfreq : int

        spectral freq.
    rip_temp_freq : float
        How many temporal cycles / second for the spectral amplitude ripples.
        Positive means ripples have down sweeps, negative means they
        have upsweeps.
        Larger values increase ripple frequency moving forward in time.
    mod_depth : float
        How large will our spectral amplitude modulations be in general.

        The starting phase for amplitude modulation.

    ''' Extracts a (roughly) auditory system spectrogram.
    This is loosely based on the NSL toolbox. Note that many
    of these steps can be controlled with various flags
    defined above.

    Here are the steps it takes:
        1. Filter the sound with a frequencies that are erb log-spaced
        2. Extract the analytic amplitude of the sound
        3. Compression with a sigmoid
        4. Low-pass filtering this amplitude
        5. First-order derivative across frequencies (basically just
            taking the diff of successive frequencies)
        6. Half-wave rectification

    Parameters
    ----------
    audio : array, shape (n_times,)
        The input sound.
    n_bands : int, default=32
        The number of frequency bands in our filter
    filt_kind : one of ['drnl', 'nsl']
        How to extract the spectrogram. Options mean:
        drnl : a self-contained cochlea model,
               so we don't add any extra processing afterward. However,
               it seems to be unstable for high F (>5000). Look into
               brian.hears for more documentation on this.
        nsl : An implementation of the wav2aud function in the NSL toolbox.
              It is meant to mimic many processing steps of the cochlea and
              early auditory pathways. It is implemented with brian.hears.
    freq_spacing : string ['erb', 'log']
        What frequency spacing to use
    kws_spec : dictionary
        Keywords to be passed to the spectrogram function
        (DRNL or spectrogram_nsl)

    OUTPUTS
    --------
    spec : array, shape (n_frequencies, n_times)
        The extracted audio spectrogram.

    Implements a version of the "wav2aud" function in the NSL toolbox.

        5. Half-wave rectification #2
